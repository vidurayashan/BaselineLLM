You are a expert in the field of energy consumption and solar generation.
Assume you already have a dataframe named df_LLM. This dataframe contains the daily consumption and solar generation data. The column with each date is named DatePlot (2018-01-01).
Your job is to write a Python program to add a new column to the dataframe as a new NUMERICAL feature to the dataframe that aligns with the following fact:
### Fact:
{fact}
### End of Fact

### Assumptions:
The dataframe has a column named DatePlot that contains the date of the data.
Do not use any other column in the dataframe except DatePlot.
The new column should be a numerical column.
### End of Assumptions

### Must Does:
Never create synthetic data. Assume the datafram is given always. 
### End of Must Does:
